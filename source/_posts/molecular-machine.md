# Nanocar Race
Introduction from official website:
> Nanocar drivers use electrons from the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to help jolt their molecules along, typically by just tenth ofâ€‰nanometers each time, so that the nanocar race takes place on a very small scale. With about 100-1000 atoms and a lateral size of a few nanometers, a nanocar is a molecule with a distinguishable front and rear. Its chemical structure allows the nanocar to move on a surface when electrons flow through it from the STM tip. The propulsion mechanism can be either inelastic (related to the excitation of vibrational modes or to current-induced structural changes) or dipolar, resulting from the repulsion or attraction between the nanocar and the STM tip.

## Nanocar Race I

## Nanocar Race II

The second international Nanocar Race (Nanocar Race II) took place from the 24/3/2022, 11:00 a.m. to the 25/03/2022, 11:00 a.m 24h non-stop.
Eight international teams from Europe, Asia and America competed at the same time in a remote controlled mode from the CEMES-CNRS G. Dupouy-Campus in Toulouse (France).<br>
